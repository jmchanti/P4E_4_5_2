# Assignment
We have two monkeys. If both monkeys are smiling, we are in trouble. If neither monkey is smiling, we are in trouble. If only one monkey is smiling, then we are going to have a good day.

Write a program that asks the user whether each monkey is smiling or not. If we are in trouble, print "Uh oh! We're in trouble!". If we are going to have a good day, print "Yay! We're going to have a good day!"

## Starter Code in `monkeyCalculator.py`
```python
# This first 2 lines are provided for you
monkey_one = input("Is the first monkey smiling?:  ")
monkey_two = input("Is the second monkey smiling?: ")
```

## Desired Output
```
Is the first monkey smiling?:  y
Is the second monkey smiling?: n
Yay! We're going to have a good day!
Is the first monkey smiling?:  y
Is the second monkey smiling?: y
Uh Oh! We're in trouble!
```

## Test
Once you think your program is finished, run `pytest` in your terminal!
